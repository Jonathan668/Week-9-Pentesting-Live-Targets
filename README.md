# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

**Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation**


![SessionID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68896250-0f355c00-06f9-11ea-91f6-0bfa29212432.gif)



First, we go into the blue section of the Globitek website and login using our credentials from the CTFs. Then, in our URL, starting from where it says "public...," replace it with the following ```public/hacktools/change_session_id.php``` to change the Session Id. Once the session ID is changed, go into the blue section of the Globitek website on another browser. If you press login, it should automatically login without asking for user and password.


**Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)**


![SQLiInjection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68898457-7ce38700-06fd-11ea-87e8-dbbd23e43f7a.gif)



Click Select the Salesperson and click on a random person's name. The blue section has a SQLi vulnerability. To test this vulnerability, we add ```' OR 1=1'--``` to the end of the URL. For the blue section, we will get directed to a page with the message "Database query failed." For the red and green sections, nothing happens.
