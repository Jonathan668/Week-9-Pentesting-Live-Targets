# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

**Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation**


![SessionID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68896250-0f355c00-06f9-11ea-91f6-0bfa29212432.gif)


First, we go into the blue section of the Globitek website and login using our credentials from the CTFs. Then, in our URL, starting from where it says "public...," replace it with the following ```public/hacktools/change_session_id.php``` to change the Session Id. Once the session ID is changed, go into the blue section of the Globitek website on another browser. If you press login, it should automatically login without asking for user and password.


**Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)**


![SQLiInjection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68898457-7ce38700-06fd-11ea-87e8-dbbd23e43f7a.gif)


Click Select the Salesperson and click on a random person's name. The blue section has a SQLi vulnerability. To test this vulnerability, we add ```' OR 1=1'--``` to the end of the URL. For the blue section, we will get directed to a page with the message "Database query failed." For the red and green sections, nothing happens.


## Green

**Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**


![CrossSiteScripting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68902069-57f31200-0705-11ea-96de-47bed537b379.gif)


Go onto the green section of the Globitek website and click on Contact Us. We'll be directed to the Feedback page. Type in your name and email and for the feedback section, put a script as such: ```<script>alert('Jonathan found the XSS!');</script>``` and hit submit. Next, Login and press the feedback button and our message will appear as a popoup. 


**Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration**


![UserNumeration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68902532-95a46a80-0706-11ea-8a6c-5eddfb1781a1.gif)


Go onto the green section of the Globitek website and login. Type an existing user such as ```jmonroe99``` and a random wrong password. It will say **Log in was unsuccessful** in bold text. When we inspect the page, we can see the class for a correct username is "failure." If we put in a wrong username and wrong password, it will say Log in was unsuccessful but not in bold. And if inspect this, we will see that the class for the wrong username is "failed."


## Red

**Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**


![CrossSiteForgery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68904400-d8b50c80-070b-11ea-948a-9f98e3d37f2d.gif)


Login to the red section of the Globitek website. Click on Users, choose a user to edit and inspect the page. Change the csrf token value to anything. Then, edit the name of the user and update. The changes will be made. When we try the same procedure in the blue and green sections we get directed to a page with the message "Error: invalid request."


**Vulnerability #2: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**


![InsecureDirectObjectReference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54424389/68904472-0306ca00-070c-11ea-9141-401f2ffb4b10.gif)


In the red section, click on Select the Salesperson and click on a random person's name. Change the number on where it says ```id=...``` to 10 and 11. We will see two hidden people that's not on the list. When we try the same procedure in the green and blue sections, it just redirects back to the Select the Salesperson page.
